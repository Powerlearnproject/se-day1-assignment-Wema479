Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Pioneering was a manual and highly technical process, which included writing code by hand
Birth of High-Level Languages - the introduction of high-level programming languages like Fortran, COBOL, and LISP revolutionized software development
The Personal Computer Revolution -the advent of personal computers brought software development to a broader audience

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning- it involves defining project scope and resource planning
Design- the software is designed to have requisite features
Development, reviewing of code, if it is scalable, and version control
Testing- it involves ensuring your software is working properly using manual testing(humans) or automated testing (using machines)
Deployment- software now goes live and users can start using it.
Maintenance- It is done to ensure the software is running smoothly as a post-launch care measure

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear flow methodology where one process is completed before another begins, and it is most appropriate in a rigid project where minimal changes are anticipated during the lifecycle. Agile methodology is more flexible and tasks are carried out in sprints. It is more of a fast paced and iterative process. It is appropriate in projects where changes are anticipated more frequently, such as in app development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer designs systems, writes code, and collaborates with teams.
A quality assurance engineer ensures that software engineering processes and products meet quality standards
A project manager is responsible for team leadership, effective communication and problem solving

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment helps programmers to write, test, and build software. A good example is Visual Studio Code. Version control systems help developers track changes in the code of their files. An example of version control is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Evolving customer need which requires constant change of code
Communication can sometimes be a challenge since you were with diverse teams
Some strategies to overcome these challenges include accepting and adapting to evolving customer needs and having a clear communication channel to curb communication challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing uses tests for a single unit in software testing. Its goal is to validate the performance of unit components.
Integration testing means combining different software phases and testing as a group to ensure that a system is ready for testing, and it finds data flow from one module to others.
System testing is the final test to identify that the system meets the specification and criteria. It allows to check a system's compliance as per requirements.
Acceptance testing aims to evaluate whether a system complies with the end user requirements and if it is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the process of writing instructions to get the best results from AI. It is important in ensuring that you get AI to respond exactly how you want it to.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
